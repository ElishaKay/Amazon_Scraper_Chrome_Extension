Based on my research,

a) the GoDaddy Account should be pointing at Cloudflare nameservers (not GreenGeeks)

anna.ns.cloudflare.com

odin.ns.cloudflare.com


b) Gmail couldn't verify who sent this | Authenticate domain e-mail & remove the question mark

Recommends to add some text records to the DNS (CloudFlare or Digital Ocean)

Add TXT Record with value:

v=spf1 mx include:secureserver.net -all

Enabling E-mail Through Your Webhost and CloudFlare

Recommends to add an A record and an MX record

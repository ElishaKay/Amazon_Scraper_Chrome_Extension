Single Purpose Description:

Share your Amazon history with friends and family. Use the Chrome Extension to generate your Public Shopping Profile within minutes.


Why Do you need tabs permission:

The app cycles through the user's Amazon Order History Pages to generate a Public Shopping Profile within minutes. Sensitive data like credit cards or Order IDs are never saved - instead, the app only fetches whatever is necessary to populate the user's Social Shopping Dashboard, such as Publicly Available Product Details.


Do you have Remote code? False

    <p>Step 1: By pressing 'Gather My Purchase History', we'll automatically visit your Amazon Orders page, and send it to your <strong>My Amazon History</strong> Dashboard.</p>

    <p>This will allow you to easily share your Amazon Shopping history with friends and family.</p>

    <a ng-click="fetchAmazonData($scope.client)" class="btn btn-block btn-info">
        Gather My Purchase History</a>

    <p>Please note:</p>

    <p>a) <strong>My Amazon History</strong> will never save sensitive data like credit cards or order ids - instead, the app only fetches whatever is necessary to populate your Social Shopping Dashboard, such as Public Product Details.</p>

    <p>b) Once the fetching is complete, you will have the option to hide, show, or write reviews on any items of your Amazon Purchase History.</p>
